Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. Since these apps and devices are easier to break into, blocking them helps keep your account safe.

To disable this security feature:

    Sign in to Gmail
    Click here to access Less Secure App Access in My Account.
    Next to “Allow less secure apps: OFF,” select the toggle switch to turn ON.

This setting may not be available for:

    Accounts with 2-Step Verification enabled: Such accounts require an application-specific password for less secure apps access.
